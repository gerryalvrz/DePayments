# Deployment Checklist

## üö® Critical Pre-Testing Requirement

### Node.js Version Upgrade REQUIRED

**Current Issue**: Node.js v18.17.1 is blocking development and testing.

**Required Version**: >= 18.18.0 (or preferably >= 20.0.0 for best Next.js 15 support)

### How to Upgrade Node.js

#### Option 1: Using nvm (Recommended)
```bash
# Install/update to latest LTS
nvm install --lts
nvm use --lts
nvm alias default node  # Set as default

# Verify
node --version  # Should show >= 20.x.x
```

#### Option 2: Using Homebrew (macOS)
```bash
brew upgrade node
node --version
```

#### Option 3: Download from nodejs.org
Visit https://nodejs.org/ and download the LTS version.

## üîÑ Next Steps (After Node.js Upgrade)

### 1. Environment Setup
```bash
# After upgrading Node.js:
npm install           # Reinstall dependencies
npx prisma generate   # Regenerate Prisma client
```

### 2. Code Quality Checks
```bash
npm run lint          # ESLint validation
npm run build         # Production build test
```

### 3. Start Development Server
```bash
npm run dev           # Should start on http://localhost:3000
```

### 4. Manual Testing (Follow TESTING_GUIDE.md)

#### PSM Journey (~30 min)
- [ ] PSM registration
- [ ] Certification upload
- [ ] Payment processing ($65)
- [ ] Session management
- [ ] Mark sessions complete
- [ ] Receive evaluations

#### User Journey (~30 min)
- [ ] User registration
- [ ] Browse PSMs with filters
- [ ] Select therapist
- [ ] Book session
- [ ] Cancel session
- [ ] Rate completed session

#### Edge Cases (~30 min)
- [ ] User without PSM
- [ ] PSM without certification
- [ ] Empty states
- [ ] Network errors
- [ ] Invalid inputs
- [ ] Concurrent bookings

### 5. Database Verification
```bash
npx prisma studio     # Verify data integrity
```

### 6. Smart Contract Testing
- [ ] Verify ZeroDev integration
- [ ] Test gasless transactions
- [ ] Check contract interactions on Alfajores

---

## üìä Testing Metrics

**Estimated Testing Time**: 2-3 hours
- Setup: 15 min
- PSM Journey: 30 min
- User Journey: 30 min
- Edge Cases: 30 min
- Bug Fixes: 30-60 min
- Regression: 15 min

---

## üêõ Known Considerations

1. **Smart Wallet Initialization**
   - Requires Privy authentication + wallet presence
   - ZeroDev Kernel account creation may take 2-3 seconds

2. **File Upload**
   - Currently using base64 encoding (temp solution)
   - Consider migrating to cloud storage (S3/Cloudinary) in future

3. **Commission Calculation**
   - Handled both in Solidity and database
   - Ensure consistency between contract and API

4. **Alfajores Testnet**
   - May have RPC rate limits
   - Test with realistic delays

5. **Frame Context**
   - Farcaster frames hide sidebar/topbar
   - Test both contexts if applicable

---

## üöÄ Post-Testing Deployment Steps

### 1. Environment Variables
Ensure all production env vars are set:
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_PRIVY_APP_ID`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_PRIVY_CLIENT_ID`
- `DATABASE_URL`
- `DIRECT_URL`

### 2. Database Migration
```bash
npx prisma migrate deploy
```

### 3. Build for Production
```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

### 4. Smoke Test Production
- [ ] Health check endpoints
- [ ] PSM registration flow
- [ ] Session booking flow
- [ ] Evaluation submission

### 5. Monitor
- [ ] Error logs
- [ ] Transaction success rates
- [ ] API response times
- [ ] Database connection pool

## üìû Support

If issues arise during testing:
1. Check TESTING_GUIDE.md for detailed test procedures
2. Review IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md for architecture
3. Check Prisma logs: `npx prisma studio`
4. Check browser console for client errors
5. Check network tab for API failures

---

## üéØ Success Criteria

**Ready to Deploy When**:
- [x] All TypeScript errors resolved
- [ ] All linter warnings addressed
- [ ] PSM journey works end-to-end
- [ ] User journey works end-to-end
- [ ] Edge cases handled gracefully
- [ ] Smart wallet transactions succeed
- [ ] Database integrity maintained
