## üìù Development Notes

### For Future Implementation

**Certifications Page Template**:
```typescript
// Multi-step: 'upload' | 'payment' | 'pending' | 'approved'
// Use FileUploader component for document upload
// Use existing DepositModal with Transak for $65 payment
// Fetch certification status from /api/certifications?psmId=xxx
// Show status: pendiente, aprobada, rechazada
```

**Sessions Page Template**:
```typescript
// Tabs: const [tab, setTab] = useState<'upcoming'|'past'|'all'>('upcoming')
// Fetch: /api/sessions?usuarioId=xxx or ?psmId=xxx
// Filter by estado: programada, completada, cancelada
// Show EvaluationModal for completed sessions without evaluation
// Show SessionBookingModal for booking new sessions
```

### Upgrade Paths
1. **File Upload**: Swap base64 for Vercel Blob (5 minutes)
2. **Email Notifications**: Add SendGrid/Resend after session bookings
3. **Calendar View**: Add react-big-calendar to sessions page
4. **Admin Panel**: Create `/admin` for certification approvals

## üôè Next Steps for You

**To Continue Implementation**:
1. Review this summary and PROGRESS.md
2. Start with certifications page (highest priority)
3. Use FileUploader and DepositModal components
4. Follow patterns from existing pages
5. Test with real database data

**To Test Current Work**:
1. Run `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to `/psms` to see enhanced browse page
3. Click "Select Therapist" to test assignment flow
4. Check browser console for API calls

**Questions to Answer**:
1. Where should users go after selecting a therapist? (Currently: /sessions)
2. Should certification be required before PSM can receive assignments? (Currently: yes, filtered by status=certified)
3. What happens if session booking fails? (Currently: shows error, can retry)
