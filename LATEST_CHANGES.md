## 🧪 Testing Checklist (Not Yet Done)

### Certifications Flow:
- [ ] Upload valid document → reaches payment step
- [ ] Payment processing → moves to pending
- [ ] Admin approves → PSM activated
- [ ] Upload rejected → can retry
- [ ] Already certified → shows approved state

### Sessions Flow:
- [ ] User books session → appears in upcoming
- [ ] PSM sees booked session
- [ ] Cancel session → updates status
- [ ] Mark as complete → triggers rewards
- [ ] Rate session → updates evaluation
- [ ] Past date → moves to past tab
- [ ] Empty state → shows helpful message

### Edge Cases:
- [ ] User without PSM → no booking button
- [ ] PSM not certified → restricted access
- [ ] Network errors → graceful error handling
- [ ] Concurrent updates → no race conditions
- [ ] Browser back button → proper state
- [ ] Page refresh → loads correct state
